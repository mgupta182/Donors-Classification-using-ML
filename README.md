# Donors-Classification-using-ML
The problem is to classify the data based on income and other attributes as a potential donor. In this project, we will test out several supervised algorithms to accurately model individualsâ€™ income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. Our goal is to classify whether a data point will be having income more than $50000.
